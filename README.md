# app_awsDotNetCoreEntitySortApi
## AWS Lambda Function Application

With this application I have built a complex type sorting interface, using .NET Core served via an AWS Serverless Application (SAM). A basic React user interface handles user input and application state.

Whilst this functionality could be achieved with JavaScript alone, I wanted to demonstrate knowledge of two key .NET Core interfaces: ICompareable and IComparer.

- ICompareable (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.icomparable?view=netcore-3.1)

- IComparer (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.collections.icomparer?view=netcore-3.1)
